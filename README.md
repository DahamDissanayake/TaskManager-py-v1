# TaskManager-py-v1
The Personal Task Manager is a Python-based application that manages tasks with simple file handling. It creates a text file to store task data, automatically saving changes during add, view, update, and delete operations. Tasks are loaded from the file at startup, ensuring data is always available across sessions.
